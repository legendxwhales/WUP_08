```

## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
#adjust factors to be factors
bears$SEX<- as.factor(bears$SEX)
bears$MONTH<- as.factor(bears$MONTH)
```

## Model WEIGHT ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(WEIGHT~NECK,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```


## Compare all models that predict WEIGHT other than NECK. Then order them from worst to best by its value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better), or by RSE (residual standard error) where smaller is better. 

```{r}
simp <- lm(WEIGHT~AGE,data=bears)
plot(WEIGHT~AGE,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

The predicted weight of a bear based on age. Adjusted R-squared value of 0.5526, and Residual Standard error value of 81.47.
